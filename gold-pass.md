# Gold Pass Subscription — Product Case Study

## Overview
Gold Pass was a subscription feature launched for a live-service mobile game with over **10M+ users**.  
The goal was to improve **mid-term retention** and create a **predictable monetization stream** without hurting player experience.

**Role:** Associate Product Manager  
**Product Type:** Consumer mobile game (Live Ops)  
**Focus Areas:** Retention, Monetization, Engagement

---

## Problem
- Strong early engagement but noticeable drop after week 3–4  
- Monetization relied heavily on one-time purchases  
- No recurring value proposition for mid-tenure players  

This led to:
- Inconsistent revenue  
- Lower lifetime value  
- Higher churn during non-event periods  

---

## Goals
- Improve **30-day retention**
- Increase **ARPU** sustainably
- Encourage daily engagement without pay-to-win mechanics

---

## Hypothesis
A **time-bound subscription** with daily rewards and progression incentives would:
- Increase daily return rate  
- Smooth revenue over time  
- Improve retention for mid-tenure users  

---

## My Responsibilities
- Defined the subscription value proposition and MVP scope  
- Partnered with design on reward cadence and UX  
- Worked with engineering to balance MVP vs future extensibility  
- Defined success metrics: retention (D7/D30), ARPU, engagement frequency  

---

## Execution
- Shipped MVP Gold Pass with daily rewards and progression bonuses  
- Monitored early cohorts for fatigue and drop-off points  
- Iterated reward pacing post-launch based on engagement trends  

---

## Results
- 📈 **+10% improvement in 30-day retention**
- 💰 **+9–11% increase in ARPU**
- 🚀 **8–12% feature adoption** within first 30 days

---

## Learnings
- Subscription success depends more on **habit formation** than rewards alone  
- Reward pacing is critical to avoid fatigue  
- Small UX changes can significantly impact perceived value  

---

## What I’d Do Next
- Segment users by spender vs non-spender behavior  
- Test multiple pricing tiers  
- Introduce milestone-based rewards instead of purely daily incentives
