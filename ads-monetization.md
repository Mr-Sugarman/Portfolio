# Ads Monetization — UX-Safe Revenue Growth

## Overview
This case study covers optimizing **ads monetization** in a live-service mobile game while protecting **user experience, retention, and payer conversion**.

**Role:** Associate Product Manager  
**Product Type:** Consumer mobile game (Live Ops)  
**Focus Areas:** Ads Monetization, UX Safety, Revenue Optimization  
**User Scale:** 10M+ users

---

## Situation
Ad revenue was **inconsistent**, and existing **interstitial placements** raised concerns around:
- Player frustration
- Retention impact
- Risk to payer conversion

There was a clear need to improve ad yield **without degrading core gameplay or long-term value**.

---

## Task
Increase **ad ARPDAU and eCPM** while:
- Preserving retention
- Avoiding negative impact on payer conversion
- Maintaining a UX-safe experience

---

## Approach

### 1) Shift to High-Intent, Opt-In Moments
- Replaced interruptive interstitials with **opt-in rewarded ads**
- Placed ads at **moments of need** (post-hand loss, out-of-chips states)
- Applied **frequency caps and cooldowns** by cohort (non-payer vs. payer)

### 2) Optimize Yield Through Controlled Experiments
- Tuned mediation **floor prices** and **reward sizes**
- Ran controlled tests to balance fill rate vs. eCPM
- Moved interruptive placements **away from active gameplay**

### 3) Guardrail-First Measurement
Defined and monitored guardrails before scaling:
- Retention deltas vs. holdout cohorts
- Payer-conversion deltas
- Session length and engagement trends

Any negative signal triggered immediate rollback.

---

## Results
- 📈 **+18–25% lift in ad ARPDAU**
- 💰 **+22–30% improvement in eCPM** through mediation and reward tuning
- 🟢 **No statistically significant change in retention** (±0.5% vs. holdouts)
- 🟢 **No negative impact on payer conversion** (±0.3%)
- ⏱ **Session length stable to +2%**, indicating UX was preserved

Overall, monetization improved meaningfully while maintaining player trust and engagement.

---

## Results Summary

| Metric | Outcome |
|------|--------:|
| Ad ARPDAU | +18–25% |
| eCPM | +22–30% |
| Retention delta | ±0.5% (within CI) |
| Payer conversion delta | ±0.3% |
| Session length | Stable to +2% |

---

## Key Learnings
- Opt-in ads at **high-intent moments** outperform interruptive formats
- Ads monetization must be treated as a **product surface**, not a revenue toggle
- Guardrails enable faster experimentation with lower risk

---

## GTM Translation
- **Spend & placement efficiency mindset:** monetize only at high-intent moments  
- **Yield optimization with guardrails:** scale only when retention and payer health are protected  
- **Sustainable monetization:** better long-term LTV over short-term spikes
