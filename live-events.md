# Live Events to Reduce Seasonal Churn — Product Case Study

## Overview
This case study focuses on designing and launching **live in-game events** to counter predictable seasonal churn in a large-scale consumer mobile game.

**Role:** Associate Product Manager  
**Product Type:** Live-service mobile game  
**Focus Areas:** Retention, Engagement, Live Ops  
**User Scale:** 10M+ users

## Problem
The product experienced **predictable seasonal drops in DAU** during off-peak periods, leading to:
- Lower short-term retention  
- Revenue volatility  
- Reduced player engagement  

Discount-based incentives had diminishing returns and risked devaluing the product.

---

## Goal
- Reduce DAU drop during high-risk seasonal windows  
- Increase short-term retention without heavy discounts  
- Re-engage existing users through contextual relevance  

---

## Insight
Cricket had **strong emotional and cultural relevance** for the core user base.  
Aligning in-game events with real-world cricket moments could drive organic engagement.

- Definedi defined event mechanics, rewards, and timelines  
- Partnered with design and engineering to scope rapid delivery  
- Defined success metrics: DAU delta, session frequency, short-term retention  

---

## Execution
- Launched limited-time cricket live events synchronized with real-world matches  
- Implemented progression-based rewards to encourage repeat sessions

---

## Results

---

## Learnings
