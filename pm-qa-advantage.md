# PM × QA Advantage — Product Case Study

## Overview
This case study highlights how my background in **quality engineering** strengthens my effectiveness as a **Product Manager**, especially at scale.

**Role:** Product Manager  
**Focus Areas:** Quality, Risk Mitigation, Product Trust  
**User Scale:** 10M+ users

---

## The Common Problem
Many PM teams struggle with:
- Late discovery of edge cases  
- Risky launches  
- Slower iteration due to post-release issues  

---

## My Advantage
My QA background allows me to:
- Identify high-risk user flows early in PRDs  
- Define realistic release quality bars  
- Partner effectively with engineering on rollout strategy  

---

## Impact
- 📉 **35% reduction in post-launch hotfixes**  
- 🟢 **99.5% crash-free sessions** across platforms  
- 🚀 Faster iteration cycles with higher release confidence  

---

## Why This Matters
Quality is not a cost center — it is **product trust**.

Products that launch cleanly:
- Retain users better  
- Enable faster experimentation  
- Build long-term credibility  

---

## How I Apply This as a PM
- Embed quality thinking into PRD creation  
- Validate edge cases during discovery, not QA  
- Balance speed with risk using data, not intuition  

---

## What This Enables
- Faster decision-making  
- Safer experimentation  
- Higher confidence launches at scale
